# For Xamarin, change some constants located in some class of the app.
# In this sample, suppose we have an AppConstant.cs class in shared folder with follow content:
#
# namespace Core
# {
#     public class Configs.AppSettingsConstants
#     {
#         public const string ApiUrl = "https://myapp.com/api";
#     }
# }
# 
# Suppose in our project exists two branches: master and develop. 
# We can release app for production API in master branch and app for test API in develop branch. 
# We just need configure this behaviour with environment variable in each branch :)
# 
# The same thing can be perform with any class of the app.
#
# AN IMPORTANT THING: FOR THIS SAMPLE YOU NEED DECLARE API_URL ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE IN APP CENTER BUILD CONFIGURATION.
